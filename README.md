# Shop
I created the 'Shop' in C++, which enable users to manage the inventory of a shop and  create a Basket with products.The project implements essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and provides various filtering options.It follows object-oriented programming principles(Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance), employs a layered architecture, adheres to GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) principles, and is using QT for GUI.  

 The application manages different products and provides various functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting products. Please refer to the user interface screenshots below.

Take a look at the UI :
We can filter or sort our products by different properties(name,price,producer):
